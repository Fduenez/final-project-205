Future work: We want our saved image to be shared using our emails and send them to others. We also wanted to crop the image and zoom in and out of the picture.
The restore image button, the filtering combo box, and the number generator were working well during testing. When we wanted to get rid of hard code,
our program began to break when certain features were to be accessed. Our future work would be to fix these unexpected feature crashes while adding in the
functionality of the crop and zoom buttons.
